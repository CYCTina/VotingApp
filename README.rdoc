== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Thanks to the Seattle Railsbridge Meetup Group for hosting the Ruby on Rails workshop. I started making the first version of this app during the workshop and created a second version afterward. This is my very first Rails app! Definitely not as simple and boring as a "Hello World" app! Enjoy, and stay tuned for my big projects in the near future!
